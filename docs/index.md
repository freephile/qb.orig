Intro
-----

QualityBox is a service for hosting MediaWiki similar to what is used to run Wikipedia. There are other options for installing MediaWiki on your own server, like <code>sudo apt-get install mediawiki</code>. But that is just a starting point whereas QualityBox is the full endpoint. By leveraging the Ansible orchestration tool, QualityBox allows you to provision virtual machines locally (using Vagrant + VirtualBox) or in the cloud (e.g. Digital Ocean droplets).  For MediaWiki consultants, this turbo-charges your DevOps **and** Delivery.  For organizations wishing to deploy MediaWiki, QualityBox eliminates many of the hurdles along the way. QualityBox opens up the pathway to better support, training, integration or extension by the same people and organizations that develop QualityBox.
