QualityBox features a grid layout. There is a Top navbar, bottom footer with all your content in the middle. <sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>

There are two choices for the "Look and Feel" (some projects like [Drupal](https://freephile.org/wiki/Drupal "wikilink") or [WordPress](https://freephile.org/wiki/WordPress "wikilink") call this a 'theme', while the MediaWiki project calls it a 'skin'). QualityBox offers both [Chameleon](https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-skins-chameleon) and [Foreground](http://foreground.wikiproject.net/wiki/Main_Page). Both of these theme choices take the bland out of the normal MediaWiki Look and Feel. They provide not only a pleasant user experience but also one that is mobile-first; which adds to your Search Engine Optimization.

Chameleon
---------

The Chameleon skin uses Twitter's [Bootstrap](https://freephile.org/wiki/Bootstrap "wikilink") 3 to provide a customizable MediaWiki skin. Not only can you customize the layout internally, but you can also adapt it using free drop-in replacement CSS from places like <https://bootswatch.com/> <sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup>
