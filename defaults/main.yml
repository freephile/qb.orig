### Package based variables
# Apache has a different package name depending on the distribution:
# For Ubuntu or Debian, it's apache2 while for CentOS or RHEL it's httpd
# We could just configure a variable here instead of using 'when' in a task
# when: ansible_distribution == 'CentOS' or ansible_distribution == 'Red Hat Enterprise Linux'
# Another option is to dynamically include a hostOS configuration file based on the OS detection
# like Ubuntu.yml v CentOS.yml 
# For right now, this whole setup only targets Ubuntu.  But, we've at least switched to
# the 'package' module which abstracts the handler v. using the 'apt' module.
